    "\n",
    "Why is this important? Scroll back up to the XKCD example - the Bayesian statistician draws a less absurd conclusion because their prior belief in the likelihood that the sun will go nova is extremely low. So, even when updated based on evidence from a detector that is $35/36 = 0.972$ accurate, the prior belief doesn't shift enough to change their overall opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Bayes Theorem Iteratively (repeated testing)\n",
    "\n",
    "This example comes from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to apply Bayes' theorem - one less absurd example is to apply it to drug tests. You may think that a drug test that is 100% accurate for true positives (detecting somebody who is a user) is pretty good, but what if it also has 1% false positive rate (indicating somebody is a user when they're not)? And furthermore, the rate of drug use in the population at large (and thus our prior belief) is 1/200.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the likelihood somebody really is drunk if they test positive? Some may guess it's 99% - the difference between the true positives and the false positives. But we have a prior belief of the background/true rate of drug use. Sounds like a job for Bayes' theorem!\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bayes Theorem Drug Test Example](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/95c6524a3736c43e4bae139713f3df2392e6eda9)\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the likelihood that somebody is a user given they tested positive on a drug test is only 33.2% - probably much lower than you'd guess. This is why, in practice, it's important to use repeated testing to confirm. If we have the same individual who tested positive the first time take the drug test a second time then the posterior probability from our the first test becomes our new prior during the second application. What is the probability that a person is a drug user after two positive drug tests in a row?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem has been relevant in court cases where proper consideration of evidence was important. Whether it's a drug test, breathalyzer, pregnancy test, doctor's diagnosis, or neutrino detector, we have to take into account **both** the false positive rate and our prior probability in order to calculate the correct conditional probability."
